This is the code repository for [Mastering Assembly Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-assembly-programming?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787287488), published by Packt.

**From instruction set to kernel module with Intel processor**

## What is this book about?
The Assembly language is the lowest level human readable programming language on any platform. Knowing the way things are on the Assembly level will help developers design their code in a much more elegant and efficient way. It may be produced by compiling source code from a high-level programming language (such as C/C++) but can also be written from scratch. Assembly code can be converted to machine code using an assembler.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Obtain deeper understanding of the underlying platform
* Understand binary arithmetic and logic operations
* Create elegant and efficient code in Assembly language
* Understand how to link Assembly code to outer world
* Obtain in-depth understanding of relevant internal mechanisms of Intel CPU

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
fld [radius]   ; Load radius to ST0
               ; ST0 <== 0.2345
fldpi          ; Load PI to ST0
               ; ST1 <== ST0
               ; ST0 <== 3.1415926
fmulp          ; Multiply (ST0 * ST1) and pop
               ; ST0 = 0.7367034
fadd st0, st0  ; * 2
               ; ST0 = 1.4734069
fstp [result]  ; Store result
               ; result <== ST0
```
